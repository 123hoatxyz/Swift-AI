# Swift AI Examples
This collection of example projects has been prepared to demonstrate real-world usage of Swift AI.  If you have more ideas, open an [issue](https://github.com/collinhundley/Swift-AI/issues) or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/collinhundley/Swift-AI/pulls).  We'd love to hear your feedback!

## iOS
The Swift AI iOS app serves two purposes:
- Provide visual representations of the "learning" process involved in machine learning.
- Demonstrate the possibilities of using artificial intelligence in iOS apps.

The following examples are included in the app:

### Regression
##### Feed-Forward Neural Network

### Evolution

##### Genetic Algorithm

Genetic algorithm example coming soon!


### Additional Notes

> **What's this 'APKit' framework?**

APKit is a framework for creating views programmatically using Auto Layout, and contains abstractions for many common animation tasks.  It has no direct effect on Swift AI's implementation.


## OS X

Some information about the OS X project will go here :)
