# Swift AI
A high-performance AI and Machine Learning library written entirely in Swift.
These tools have been optimized for use in both iOS and OS X applications, with support for more platforms coming soon!

### Features
- [x] Multi-Layer Feed-Forward Neural Network
- [ ] Recurrent Neural Network
- [ ] Convolutional Network
- [ ] GPU-Accelerated Networks
- [ ] Genetic Algorithms
- [ ] Fast Matrix Library
- [ ] Fourier Transform Functions

### Compatibility
Swift AI currently relies on Apple's Accelerate framework for vector/matrix calculations and digital signal processing. With Swift becoming open-source later this year, it remains to be seen if any frameworks will be released as well.

In order to provide support for multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, etc.), alternative BLAS solutions are being considered. A vanilla Swift implementation is possible, but SIMD instructions are desirable for their significant performance boost.

### Usage
Pick the files you need, drag them into your project. That was easy!

#### Feed-Forward Neural Network
Put some instructions and examples here.
